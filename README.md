# Forecasting dwelling prices in the City of Madrid: a comprehensive analysis of the Real Estate market
This repository has been created to store my Master's Thesis work as a student of Master in Computational Social Science in University Carlos III of Madrid.

## Project description
This project is about the Real Estate market prices in the area of Madrid City. The idea is to make an introduction of the situation that motivates the work and then incorporate some external variables to try to enhance predictive power. Finally, it is desired to find out a tool which allows to predict well prices.

## Installation instructions
This project uses R languaje and RStudio to run the code. All along the work, as explained there, several packages and libraries are needed.

## Usage guide
The recommended steps to carry out to understand the project and follow the workflow is to read the document together with executing the corresponding markdown (.Rmd).
All plots created in R are also shown in the written document, nevertheless, many affirmations and conclusions extracted come from the .Rmd.
Markdown structure is the following:

- [house_prices_I.Rmd](house_prices_I.Rmd) corresponds to sections **1. INTRODUCTION** and **2. ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION**
- [house_prices_II.Rmd](house_prices_II.Rmd) corresponds to section **3. DATA EXTRACTION AND PREPROCESSING**
- [house_prices_III.Rmd](house_prices_III.Rmd) corresponds to sections **4. MODELLING** and **5. CONCLUSIONS**

The user will also find associated .html files for *house_prices_I.Rmd* and *house_prices_II.Rmd*. For the third case it has not been possible due to computational limitations of my computer.

## File structure
In this repository the reader can find all necessary files to read and run the project.
